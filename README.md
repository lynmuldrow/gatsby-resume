## ðŸŒº Intro ðŸŒº
I started this personal portfolio during a job search, to brush up on Gatsby and continue my practice with writing clean code. I continued to benefit new Gatsby developers and for the [DigitalOceanxDEV App Platform Hackathon(https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k). It's a minimalist portfolio, including sections for **social**, **projects**, **contact**, and **about** content. 

Personal portfolios are forever works in progress, and I plan to update the look, feel, and interactions on this portfolio as I feel moved.

Feel free to take a fork and use this portfolio as a starting point for your own!

## Usage
To run this application, you'll need the following: 

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/)

To start the application, run: 

```js
npm run develop
```

This will start a local instance of the app, accessible at http://localhost:8000 . From there, you can start making changes and seeing them in realtime in your browser. I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) plugins, but its compatible with most editors.

## ðŸŒº Contributing ðŸŒº
I'd love to make this useful for the new developer community, so feel free to submit a PR with UI changes. I'll review/merge as I can. Thanks for contributing to open source!
